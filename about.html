        <h3>LEARN THROUGH GAMES</h3>
        <p>One of our most fun programs is the Native American games program. This program was developed by native people who are expert in games which focus on having fun and developing team skills and hand and eye cordination. <br> Students identify game they like to play most and have fun playing and developing skills. <br> After game playing the group discuss ways these skills
        would help Native American people of long ago and how the skill could be useful today. </p>
